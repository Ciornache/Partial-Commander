Change C++ version from 14 to 17, so that filesystem works.
To setup SFML, you need to follow these steps. First, make sure you make these changes in the x86/Win32 variant of the project.
1. Go to C/C++(General) and add the path to the include folder in sfml (C:\SFML-2.6.1\include).
2. Go to C/C++(Preprocessor) and and SFML_STATIC;
3. Go to Linker(General) and add the path to the lib folder in sfml (C:\SFML-2.6.1\lib).
4. Go to Linker(Input) and add all these dependencies for the libraries:
sfml-graphics-s-d.lib
opengl32.lib
freetype.lib
sfml-window-s-d.lib
winmm.lib
gdi32.lib
sfml-audio-s-d.lib
openal32.lib
flac.lib
vorbisenc.lib
vorbisfile.lib
vorbis.lib
ogg.lib
sfml-network-s-d.lib
sfml-system-s-d.lib
ws2_32.lib

If you have manager to follow all these steps, run the code below, and you should see a green circle.
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

int main()
{
    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(200, 200), "SFML works!");
    sf::CircleShape shape(100.f);
    shape.setFillColor(sf::Color::Green);

    while (window.isOpen())
    {
        sf::Event event;
        while (window.pollEvent(event))
        {
            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
                window.close();
        }

        window.clear();
        window.draw(shape);
        window.display();
    }

    return 0;
}
